The firmware files can be uploaded to your Agilent 82357A/B adapter
using fxload.  The 82357a_fw.hex file is for the 82357A and the
measat_releaseX1.8.hex file is for the 82357B.

There is apparently a bug in the 82357B firmware which causes the
first firmware upload to an 82357B to fail.  After the first
attempt, the device will disconnect then reconnect (with a
new address), but will still be in an uninitialized state with
device id 518.  Loading the firmware a second time will
cause the device to disconnect again, but this time it when
it comes back it will be fully functional with device id 718.
If you have your OS set up to
automatically load the firmware, you
won't notice this bug, since it will just cause the OS to
automatically load the firmware twice.


Examples:

fxload -D /proc/bus/usb/001/002 -I 82357a_fw.hex 

fxload -t fx2 -D /proc/bus/usb/001/003 -I measat_releaseX1.8.hex


Note the 82357B requires the "-t fx2" command line option of fxload.

If you wish for the firmware to be automatically loaded through hotplug, 
copy the firmware file to the /usr/share/usb/agilent_8237a/ directory
(or wherever the /etc/hotplug/usb/agilent_82357a script expects to find it).
