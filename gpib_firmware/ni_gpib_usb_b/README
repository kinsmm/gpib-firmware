The firmware files can be uploaded to your NI GPIB-USB-B adapter
using fxload.  Example:

fxload -D /proc/bus/usb/001/002 -I niusbb_firmware.hex -s niusbb_loader.hex

If you wish for the firmware to be automatically loaded through hotplug, 
copy the firmware files to the /usr/share/usb/ni_usb_gpib/ directory
(or wherever the /etc/hotplug/usb/ni_usb_gpib script expects to find them).

Thanks go to Michael Ritzert for figuring out how to extract the firmware
from a usb sniff log.  The log that was used is included
(file name is "ni-usb-b-initialization-log.txt"), as well as the perl 
script for creating the hex file ("firmware_extract.pl").
